# CourtCounter


## Android Application: Keeps track of basketball scores for two teams. Utilized ConstraintLayout.


This project is about combining various ideas and skills, they include:
* Planning app design before coding.
* Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
* Creating, positioning, and styling views.
* Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
* Commenting and documenting code.
* Adding button code to app
* Updating views
* Properly scoping variables
* Finding views by their ID

###Utilized: ConstraintLayout 2.0.0 [an Android Jetpack library]
Which allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).
